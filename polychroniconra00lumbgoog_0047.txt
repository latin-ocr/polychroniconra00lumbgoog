Credibility Ι have chus lar briefly gone over lhe ohaplers of
pppffpatllue Higden's firso' book hersin-after contained, wilh a view
,asanhiii' lo indicate the authorilies upon which lhey profess lo
mm depend; al 'che same lime, when Ι could, I have poiuled
ouh his ,sources of information when he has himself
wiehheld theru, us in his chaphers on ihc islanda oi lhe
Mediterranean ou Norlhern Europe, aud on Wales. Such
cases also as I have observed of erroneous citatione,
those for example of Priscian, Eutropius, aud Herodohus,

' have been pointed ouo, and in one or lwo instancss
corrected. Al ,lhe same lime, I fear 'chal 'chere are

. more errors of 'citatiou ohan Ι have myself discovered,
and au increased knowledge of Higden has more and
ruore, ocuviuoed rue of his inaccuracy. Nol, indeed,
chao this faulo is lo be very severely deall wilh,
when we bear in mind ohe age in which he lived3
bul ic is nol che less a cause of disquiel ond per-

’ plexily lo his edilor. We have also oo regrel 'chal
Higdeu has drawn so much from unlruslworlhy autho·
rilies. For recoun'cing 'che Trojan origin of lhe

European natione, and ohe absurdities which had olus-

' Ὗ hored about ohe history of Alexander che Greal, and ·
avariely of fabulous narratives relaling lo disoeno
lando and ancisus limes, we ought nol lelex Higdeu
severely3 more especially as in some cases, for
example when repealing ohe marvels current aboul
Rome, he expresses doubts respecling 'cheir truhh. Ae

, 'ohe same lime, we cannot bul feel disappointment ¹
'chal his account of oouulries which lay nearer home, ἵ
as Seolland and Wales, should couoain so litlle chao ,
18 valuable, and so much thal is ullerly worlhless
and absurd. For ohe resl we need only say, charcha
value of lhe history and geography varies much wilh
che aulhors quoled3 whose sense Higden has in general η

- represenled wilh orulhfulrress aud wilh rnuoh elegance ¹
