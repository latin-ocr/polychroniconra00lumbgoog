fine MS, and earlier than the preceding. Henry Wharss
. ton says of it: “Ex quamplurimis, quos vidi, historie
“ istius codicibus manu scriptis longe pulcherrimus est'
“ qui in collegio Gonvilii et Gaii, cujus ipsemet alumnus
“ fui, asservatur.'' Tanner also calls it “omnium 2
“ pulcherrimum.'’ It is a folio, on vellum, of 191 ’
leaves, in two columns, each column of about 45 lines,

The MS. has no original title, and no note cr notes ¹

The scribe of MS. B. was evidently often unable tc
read his original well, for he sometimes leaves'a space
for a word which he cannot understand, sometimes runs ⁵
two words into one, and occasionally distorte the ortho- ,

graphy cf a word in such a manner as to make it ἵ
ἶ unintelligible. ’ ’
