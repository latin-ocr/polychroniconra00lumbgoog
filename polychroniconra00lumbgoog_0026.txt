one who knew the meaning of the word, but in the
general ignorance of Greek, the scribes, to whom the
Potpcrota'con of John oi Salisbury was a familiar name,
frequently conionnded the two words. ,The work of
Higden, moreover, is sometimes called Polycratioon:
thus our Ms. 0. has in the colophon: “ Explieiunt
“ chronicae venerahilis Ranulphi monaehi Castrensis, in
“ septem libellos distinctae, dictaeque Historia Poliorc-
.“ tioo.” In the sixteenth century Higden's work was
known under· both titlesl It is not altogether impos-
sible that Higden himself may have made the blunder,
and corrected it in his later editions ; ior it is in the
earlier Mss, so far as ,we know, that this error is
mostly to he found

(3) Very little stress can be laid on the shght diffe-

renoe of their dates. “ Ranulphurn ipsum plns quam xxii. ’ ’

“ annis praecessit,’' says Bale; but, by his own account,
Roger afterwards continued the chronicis from 1314 to 1
1339, Now, as many of Higden’s earlier copies oeese¹
at 1327, and at various years afterwards, it can scarcely
hc said that there is any differente of time between
his and Roger’s chronicles.2

The eontents of the two chronioles may be said to
