We learn from Bale, that John Rocheforth, who wrote
in the beginning of the 15th century, made a compen-
dium of the Polychronioon in one book.1

Henry Bradshaw, in fine, himself ‘fa native of

posed before the close of the loth century a Lo'fe of

his obligations to Higden: μ ’

‘¹ Gyrard Polychrona'ooa, and other mo indeed.’''
Several writers, als0, as Knyghton himself, Malverne,
Oaxton, and others, undertook the continuation of the ’
’ Polyrhrwrirw, both in the laeli and 15th centuries3
hut of these we say nothing now, reserving our account

π for the close of Higden's work. The render, however,

will easily perceive how popular the history must have
been, to heve been so often continued by other hands.

In the course of these remarks we have had oeco-
sion to quote several authors who mention Higden3
but it would bc a long undertaking to collect a oa«
tent of allusione to the Polychrono'ooa from the writers
of the llth and following centuries. In addition to
those to whom we have already referred, we may
mention the names of Wycliife,8 Purvey,⁴ 'and Thorpe,⁵
